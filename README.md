# Examples for Vala Gtk

This repository contains some basic examples for using Vala and GTK+ 3.
Each example tries to showcase some use of the widget in an easy-to-understand form.

## Usage

Before running the examples, you will need compile the sources files and for that
you need the Vala compiler.

First install the vala compiler and GTK 3 development library.

### Install vala compiler in debian and debian based systems

```
sudo apt-get install valac libgtk-3-dev
```

### Install vala compiler in Arch Linux based systems

```
sudo pacman -S vala
```

### To check the version installed in your system

```
vala --version
```

### Compile an example

Every example is a standalone file `filename.vala`.

To compile every example, use `make all`.

To compile any one example use:

```
make filename
```

or alternatively,

```
valac filename.vala --pkg gtk+-3.0
```

This will generate an executable `filename` in the directory of the repo to run it use

```
./filename
```

Keep in mind that some examples could use other packages besides gtk. Every additional
package can be included in the compiler with directive `--pkg` in the form
`--pkg package-name` for example:

```
valac webkit2.vala --pkg gtk+-3.0 --pkg webkit2gtk-4.0
```

## Other Notes
A tutorial to further explain the use of each widget may be written in the future, possibly when GTK+ 4 is released. ;)
